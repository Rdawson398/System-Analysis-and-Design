# System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
Our client, DriverPass is looking to create a system that will help students pass their test at the DMV for their driver's license. Their plan is to create a system capable of offering students online courses, practice tests, and on the road lessons. The system should offer users multiple packages to choose from, determining how many hours of on-the-road training they receive. Once they've signed up, students will be able to access courses and tests, reserve time for on-the-road lessons, view courses they have in process and driver notes, and view a log of all the actions taken on their account.

**What did you do particularly well?**
In this course, I feel that one thing I did especially well was keep all of my documentation as simple as possible. When presenting technical information, I believe that it's vitaTo inlly important that everyone involved can understand the information provided, whether they come from a technical background or not. Throughout this course, I did my best to simplify things as much as possible, avoiding jargon and breaking down terms. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
One part of these documents that I would revise if possible is my UML Use Case Diagram. While I feel that I did a good job of logging most of the use cases that come along with the system, I feel there's still more that I may have missed. My diagram does not include the driver as an actor or an IT Administrator capable of adding or removing employee admin access when an employee is hired or fired. I feel that adding these pieces would give my diagram a more full overview of the system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Interpretting user needs involves a combination of active listening and attention to detail. For the DriverPass system, all information on the system's design came directly from the client's goals. As part of the development team, it's important to both determine ways to deliver on these goals while also understanding the smaller steps involved that the client may not think about. This can be done by putting yourself into the user's shoes and clearly envisioning what you'd like to see every step of the way. The users are who the system is built for, so considering their needs is vital.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
When developing programs, I look to take a modular approach. Programs should be clean and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features and updates. Through this process, I also hope to incorporate Agiles iteration based development process into my own work. This process allows me to complete projects faster while also leaving room for new features suggested by users, keeping the system relevant and up-to-date.
